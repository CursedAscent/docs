# Cursed Ascent

**Cursed Ascent** is an roguelite deck-building game hosted on starknet testnet. The goal is to explore proceduraly generated spires and to fight all kind of foes using cards.
We designed an open contract achitecture so any team can implements it's own game using already-deployed cards, enemies and scenes collections.

This game have been developed during the [MatchboxDAO Hackathon #2](https://golden-racer-395.notion.site/MatchboxDAO-Virtual-Hackathon-2-c811b98546144251bcbba725fe6d787d) in October 2022.
Since it's our first experience with Starknet and Cairo, we learned everything we needed during the hackathon (and a bit before, thanks to some preparations).
We manage to implement all the contracts (_with some missing features_) and an web interface to interact with them.
