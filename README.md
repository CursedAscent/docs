# Cursed Ascent

**Cursed Ascent** is a roguelite deck-building game hosted on starknet testnet. The goal is to explore procedurally generated spires and fight all kinds of foes using cards.
We've designed an open contract achitecture so any developer can implement their own game using already-deployed cards, enemies and scenes collections.

This game and all the architecture has been designed and coded during the [MatchboxDAO Hackathon #2](https://golden-racer-395.notion.site/MatchboxDAO-Virtual-Hackathon-2-c811b98546144251bcbba725fe6d787d) in October 2022.
Since this is our first experience with Starknet and Cairo, we've learned everything we needed to code during the hackathon (and a tiny bit beforehand, by exploring cairo playground tutorial).
We managed to implement all the contracts (_with some missing features_) and a web interface to interact with them.
